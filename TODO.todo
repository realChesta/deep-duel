Todos may be found shattered around in code

// BUG Syncing is kinda buggy. To reproduce, open the game in two windows, then pause one's script while moving in the other. Full syncs only happen when a player joins, but they should regularly happen
// TODO Maybe; add diagonal animations
// TODO Consider splitting common and client parts of some classes even further - eg. split Player into PlayerRenderer (client-only) and Player, whereas the former is returned by the latter
// TODO Adjust player sprite offsets
