This is a game where you play against an AI that is constantly learning from your mistakes.

## Getting Started
First get Node.js and npm [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then update it with the following commands:
```shell
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable```

Then, cd to this directory and run `npm install`. To launch the server, use one of the following commands:

```shell
npm run-script cmd-p # for the command-line server
npm run-script ui # for the server UI```

You can then connect to your server (default `127.0.0.1:3000`).
